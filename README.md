- Typography

    The main fonts used throughout the site are 'Tillana' and 'Skranji', with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason these fonts aren't being imported into the site correctly. Both were chosen for how they resemble and complement the lettering style of the Ritual Effect logo.

- Imagery

    The general colour scheme is complemented and enhanced by the use of both black-and-white and colour images. The large background and banner images were carefully selected to be striking and catch the user's attention. All imagery on the site was chosen to portray Ritual Effect's exuberant, energetic and flamboyant nature, both on and off stage.

### Bugs

#### Fixed Bugs
- #### Header navigation menu: sizing issue

    I'm not sure if it qualifies as a bug, per se, but I noticed a sizing problem with the header on smaller screens, especially in landscape mode, when I first started to style it for responsive design. It encroached too far down onto the hero image, obscuring it, even after downsizing, but if I made the navigation menu any smaller it became difficult to see. I also wanted to avoid reducing the size of the band logo at all, if possible.

    I realised that I could solve the issue by switching the original, inline-styled navigation menu for a 'hamburger' style drop-down menu on medium to small screen sizes. I achieved this by first wrapping the original #main-menu list in a div with an id of "main-menu-inline". I then created the drop-down menu inside the same `<nav>` element in HTML by using the `<details>` element with a Font Awesome 'hamburger' icon in the `<summary>` tag, and copied the original navigation menu list into the disclosure widget. I gave it an id of "main-menu-dropdown", styled it to look like a standard drop-down menu and set the media queries to switch between the two menu styles at 800 pixels using the property `display: none;`. The media queries can be seen below.
```css
    @media screen and (min-width: 801px) {
        #main-menu-dropdown {
            display: none;
        }
    }
    @media screen and (max-width: 800px) {
        #main-menu-inline {
            display: none;
        }
    }
```
